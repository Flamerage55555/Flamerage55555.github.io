        <h1>Since 1974</h1> <br>
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>The narrative of ALBAIK started in 1974 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Jeddah when the late Shakour AbuGhazalah recognized the need for reasonably priced,
          excellent food that was delivered promptly, politely, and in a welcoming setting.  
          Shakour penned the first chapter of ALBAIK using all of his hard-earned savings, 
          making him the first person in Saudi Arabia to present the broasted chicken concept to the market.</p> <br>
        <h3>AL BAIK Purpose</h3>  
          <p>We will always uphold the integrity that God has given us and cooperate to responsibly nurture and disseminate it so that everyone,
          everywhere in the globe, can benefit from its goodness.</p> <br>
        <h3>AL BAIK Vision</h3>
          <p>Making customers say "MMMMM" and "WOOOW" every single time, everywhere in the world.
          We want to be the most loved and trusted brand in the world.</p> <br>
        <h3>AL BAIK Mission</h3>
          <p>At all times, ALBAIK ensures that the customer is loved.
          We are committed to providing our customers with the best quality food and service,
          and we will always strive to exceed their expectations.</p> <br>
